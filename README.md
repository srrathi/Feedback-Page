# Feedback-Page
This Repository contain the code for the extension uninstall feedback page.
>> Tasks Remaining
  - First of all the code look too messy, so i have to clean the code and make it human readable.
  - Remove all the bugs and setting proper pages through routing.
  - As till now the functionality to add a new option and show its count when that option is selected from user side is achieved but that only work when both
    admin option and client option are displayed on same page and also as soon as we reload the page all the options added in the state get lost.
  - As I tried adding router dom in the ending, so first of all i faced a bit difficulty in adding it and secondly after adding it in the admin side page after
    adding router a problem arise, when we input a option in the input field the input cursor come out from the input box after taking input one character and
    after it we have to again click on the input box to add another character, and this keeps on repeating after taking input one character.
  - The firebase part is still not setup, so i have to work on it as its new for me.
